## PE/MC Deadlines

Countdown timers to keep track of a bunch of PE/MC conference deadlines.

对于有摘要提交截止日期的会议，会设置两个列表，一个针对摘要截止日期，一个针对全文截止日期。

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!

To keep things minimal, I'm only looking to list top-tier conferences. Feel free to maintain a separate fork if you don't see your sub-field or conference of interest listed.

To add or update a deadline:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place`, `sub` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Optionally add a `note` and `abstract_deadline` in case the conference has a separate mandatory abstract deadline
- Send a pull request
